### Performance measurements

### FLAIR isoforms
We used the gencode.v27.transcripts.fa to align the pass native RNA and pass cDNA reads.  
Isoforms defined from FLAIR v1.1 are in [PSL format](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format2). From the native RNA data, we generated two sets of isoforms: set A and set B. Set A contains all isoforms (71,899 isoforms) from default FLAIR output with a minimum of 5 supporting reads, as described in the Online Methods. Set B (50,039 isoforms) is a more stringent set of nvRNA isoforms than set A. To generate set B, set A isoforms that are subsets of longer set A isoforms are removed and only the longest isoform of each unique splice junction chain is retained. We also have a set of FLAIR isoforms defined from cDNA data (99,574 isoforms).
